          <h3>Statism</h3>
          <p>
            The Church of Statism have existed for tens of centuries. It is fair to say that it's the oldest religious in the history of mankind.
            The members of the Church recognize the State as the supreme divine being, something that adepts of other religions would call "God".
            Throughout the history, Statism has had a veriety of different incarnations, varying from Monarchism to Democracy.
            Although different people may recognize only one of incarnations as the most truthful, all members shall have respect for one another.

        <h3>Core Dogmas</h3>
				<div class="col-lg-4 mt">
          <h3>People are evil</h3>
          <p>People are indeed evil, so it does make sense to make evil people rule evil people. The result should surely be better!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 mt">
          <h3>The Higher End</h3>
          <p>Statists hold a belief that there are higher ends than individual liberty. Different Statism branches proclaim differend ends as supreme, but they are united by the fact that all of the branches discard individual liberty.</p>
          <p>For exmaple, for some it may be the well-being of the poor, while for others it will be the war on terrorism.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 mt">
          <h3>Voluntarism is nonsense</h3>
          <p>All Statist Churches sincerely think that completely voluntary cooperation of people is not possible. (Otherwise there will be no Statism!)</p>
          <p>To prevent a state of anarchy that may arise in interpersonal, economic, and other relationships. The branches of the Statist Church are doing their best every day to fight this challenge via regulations.</p>
          <p>The Church, for exmaple, has already succeeded in preventing people from making voluntary, mutually beneficial exhcnages.</p>
